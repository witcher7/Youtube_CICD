This project demonstrates a DevOps pipeline for deploying a YouTube clone application with Kubernetes on AWS. The application uses Node.js and React, containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes. Terraform is used to provision the cloud infrastructure, and Ansible automates configuration management. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) ensures the application scales based on traffic, while Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) manage data storage. Ingress Controller with AWS ALB handles traffic routing to the application, ensuring load balancing and high availability. The Jenkins pipeline automates testing, building, containerization, and deployment processes. Monitoring and logging are handled by AWS CloudWatch, providing real-time insights into application performance and system health. This project integrates infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration, automation, scaling, and monitoring to deploy a scalable and resilient YouTube clone application in the cloud.
